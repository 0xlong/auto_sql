# AWS APP RUNNER CONFIGURATION FILE
# ============================================================================
# This file tells AWS App Runner how to build and run your application.
# It's optional - you can also configure everything in the AWS Console,
# but having this file makes deployments repeatable and version-controlled.

# Build configuration - how to build your application
build:
  # Type: docker means we're using a Dockerfile to build the container
  type: docker
  
  # Dockerfile location (relative to repository root)
  dockerfile_path: Dockerfile

# Run configuration - how to run your application
run:
  # Runtime: docker means we're running a Docker container
  runtime: docker
  
  # Command to start the application (optional - already in Dockerfile CMD)
  # If specified here, it overrides the Dockerfile CMD
  # We leave it commented out since Dockerfile already has the correct command
  # command: streamlit run src/app.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.headless=true
  
  # Network port your application listens on
  # Must match the EXPOSE port in Dockerfile
  network:
    port: 8501
    
  # Environment variables will be set in AWS Console or via AWS CLI
  # They are NOT set here for security reasons (credentials should never be in code)
